# This test verifies that in relay log code path we have initialized all
# member variables. We've seen an issue with non_xid_trxs not being initialized
# and causing relay log rotation getting stuck. This test doesn't do anything
# fancy (such as restart) and can be run in valgrind.
# Note that mysql_bin_log doesn't have uninitialized variable problem as
# all members are initialized to 0 so it's determinstic.
